    Making bots on Discord is fun but getting them out to the general users on Discord is rather hard. There are so
    many bot lists to publish your bot on that it becomes a headache, so I created BotBlock. BotBlock provides a
    single list of all known bot lists on Discord and a central API for bot developers to use.

    Producing bots to give other users a better experience on Discord resulted in my creation of a couple of music
    streaming bots based on the Discord.py library as well as some other utility bots. As part of this I produced
    a site for them all, featuring their homepages as well as a large backend for stats logging.

    Rythm is one of the largest bots on Discord with a focus on music. My job was the task of redesigning the old
    site which was a template. Producing this site was great fun as there were very few requirements from the client
    other than the content, so I had freedom of design. The site was designed to provide quick access to key info
    and links for all vistors.
