    Creating and managing a large community of JetBrains users and team members on Discord where they can all chat with
    each other about JetBrains products and projects as well as pretty much anything else. To help the community, JetBot
    was created; a python Discord bot that provides information via commands about JetBrains.

    Python has always been a language I love to work in and after setting up a load of DMX controlled lights in my
    office I needed a programatic way to control them all. With this in mind I found a basic Python usb wrapper for the
    uDMX device and built myself a custom, powerful Python module for controlling DMX fixtures using uDMX.

    cdnjs was an open source CDN service that I encountered some time ago and soon realised that their Twitter was not
    maintained and there was absolutely no form of community being built around this service. With this in mind, I
    reached out to one of the founders and soon became the community manager running the Twitter and Discord server.

    Making bots on Discord is fun but getting them out to the general users on Discord is rather hard. There are so
    many bot lists to publish your bot on that it becomes a headache, so I created BotBlock. BotBlock provides a
    single list of all known bot lists on Discord and a central API for bot developers to use.

    Unreal Designs is a business that I started up as a way to sell my web and graphic design skills to clients
    alongside a couple of my friends who also wanted to sell their skills. The business has been successful and
    long lasting, bringing in many clients for the team and building up our experience.

    Producing bots to give other users a better experience on Discord resulted in my creation of a couple of music
    streaming bots based on the Discord.py library as well as some other utility bots. As part of this I produced
    a site for them all, featuring their homepages as well as a large backend for stats logging.

    Rythm is one of the largest bots on Discord with a focus on music. My job was the task of redesigning the old
    site which was a template. Producing this site was great fun as there were very few requirements from the client
    other than the content, so I had freedom of design. The site was designed to provide quick access to key info
    and links for all vistors.
