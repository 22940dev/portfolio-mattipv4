        Unreal Designs is a business that I started up as a way to sell my web and graphic design skills to clients
        alongside a couple of my friends who also wanted to sell their skills. The business has been successful and
        long lasting, bringing in many clients for the team and building up our experience.

        Producing bots to give other users a better experience on Discord resulted in my creation of a couple of music
        streaming bots based on the Discord.py library as well as some other utility bots. As part of this I produced
        a site for them all, featuring their homepages as well as a large backend for stats logging.

        Rythm is one of the largest bots on Discord with a focus on music. My job was the task of redesigning the old
        site which was a template. Producing this site was great fun as there were very few requirements from the client
        other than the content, so I had freedom of design. The site was designed to provide quick access to key info
        and links for all vistors.

        Young Theatre is a theatre group for young people, run by young people. I have been a part of their technical
        team for many years now and have been part of many shows produced by the company. Over the multitude of shows
        I have gained a large amount of experience with all aspects of technical theatre in an enjoyable environment.
